# Angry text object

This plugin adds text object support for comma-separated arguments enclosed by
brackets.  (Etymology: "argument" is sometimes abbreviated to "arg" which
means "angry" in Swedish.)

For example, arguments in constructs like `(x, y, z)` or `[1, 32, 4]`,
`{ {x, y}, {w, h} }` can be operated on using the objects `aa` (an argument,
includes the separator) or `ia` (inner argument, excludes the separator).  The
text objects support a repeat count and can cope with nested lists, strings and
comments (strings and comments require the current file type to have proper
syntax highlighting support), as well as arguments on multiple lines.

There are also upper-case versions `aA` and `iA`.  The lower-case objects will
match a comma or bracket at the beginning of an argument, whereas the
upper-case versions match a comma or bracket at the end of an argument.  For
example, if the cursor is on the first comma of `(x, y, z)`, then `daa` will
result in `(x, z)` whereas `daA` will result in `(y, z)`.  Another way to think
of this is that `aa` includes the comma *before* an argument, whereas `aA`
includes the comma *after* an argument.

The upper-case version includes whitespace and comments after the rightmost
separator, and excludes whitespace and comments before the argument.  The
lower-case version includes whitespace and comments before the leftmost
separator, and excludes whitespace and comments after the argument.  For
example:

    call( x, /* left */ y /* right */, z )

With the cursor on the `y`, typing `daa` results in `call( x /* right */, z )`,
whereas `daA` results in `call( x, /* left */ z )`.

## Customizing

Some customization of the plugin is possible:

-   To disable all predefined mappings, add `let g:angry_disable_maps = 1`
    to your `.vimrc`.  This is useful if you dislike the choices of `aa`, `ia`,
    `aA` and `iA`.  See the script on [how to create custom mappings][plugin]
    (look right next to the `g:angry_disable_maps` check).
-   The variable `g:angry_separator` defines the separator (default `,`).  It
    can be changed to any *single character*, e.g.
    `let g:angry_separator = ':'` would set the separator to colons.
    (It is not possible set this on a per-buffer basis.)
-   The types of brackets that the text object handles can currently only be
    overridden by modifying the script itself.

## Examples

Counts are supported, so e.g. `d3aa` with the cursor on the first argument will
turn

    function(a, 33, Rstyle="calls, with commas inside strings, are OK")

into `function()`.  Note that commas inside strings are ignored and so are
comments (this feature depends on the syntax highlighting to detect strings and
comments so `'filetype'` must be set properly for this to work).

If the cursor is on the `R` in the above function call, then both `daa` and
`daA` results in `function(a, 33)` so the comma after `33` is properly deleted.


## Installation

Assuming you are using the [Pathogen plugin][pathogen], just clone this
repository in your `~/.vim/bundle` folder like so:

```
$ cd ~/.vim/bundle
$ git clone https://github.com/b4winckler/vim-angry.git
```

Alternatively, you can just put the [`angry.vim` script][plugin] in your
`~/.vim/plugin` folder (create the folder if it does not already exist).


## Deficiencies

-   Growing the selection in visual mode by repeatedly entering the text object
    is currently not supported.
-   Mismatched brackets are not handled.
-   Using the text objects outside a bracket-enclosed list can have unexpected
    consequences.
-   Empty arguments are not handled properly.
